```{r setup, include=FALSE}

## Review Last Time

1. What does `dim()` return when applied to a 1-dimensional vector?

```{r }
x <- 1:5
dim(x)
```

2. How would you describe the following three objects? What makes them different from 1:5?

```{r }
x1 <- array(1:5, c(1, 1, 5))
x2 <- array(1:5, c(1, 5, 1))
x3 <- array(1:5, c(5, 1, 1))
x1
x2
x3
```

```{r }
str(x)
str(x1)
attributes(x)
attributes(x1)
length(x)
x[[2]]
```
