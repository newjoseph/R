## Outline

- Built-in data types
- Built-in functions and operators
- First data structures: Vectors and arrays

---

## Goals

- From user input, how does R decide the type?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
x <- 5
```

- What is the expected behavior of R when types are mixed?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
x <- c(TRUE, "b", 1)

TRUE*20

c(1, 2) + 5
```

## Why good statisticians learn to program

- **Independence**: otherwise, you rely on someone else giving you exactly the right tool
- **Honesty**: otherwise, you end up distorting your problem to match the tools you have
- **Clarity**: often, turning your ideas into something a machine can do refines your thinking
- **Fun**: these were the best of times (the worst of times)

---

## Overview

This class in a nutshell: functional programming

Two types of **things/objects**: **data** and **functions**

- **Data**:  things like 7, "seven", $7.000$, the matrix $\left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 7 & 7 & 7 \\ 7 & 7 & 7\end{array}\right]$

- **Functions**: things like $\log{}$, $+$ (two arguments), $<$ (two), $\mod{}$ (two), `mean` (one)

> A function is a machine which turns input objects, or **arguments**, into an output object, or a **return value** (possibly with side effects), according to a definite rule

---

## Programming

- Programming is writing functions to transform inputs into outputs
- Good programming ensures the transformation is done easily and correctly
- Machines are made out of machines; functions are made out of functions, like $f(a,b) = a^2 + b^2$

> The trick to good programming is to take a big transformation and **break it down** into smaller ones, and then break those down, until you come to tasks which are easy (using built-in functions)

---

## Before functions, data

At base level, all data can represented in binary format, by **bits** (i.e., TRUE/FALSE, YES/NO, 1/0). Basic data types:

- **Booleans**: Direct binary values: `TRUE` or `FALSE` in R
- **Integers**: whole numbers (positive, negative or zero), represented by a fixed-length block of bits
- **Characters**: fixed-length blocks of bits, with special coding; **strings**: sequences of characters
- **Floating point numbers/doubles**: an integer times a positive integer to the power of an integer, as in $3 \times 10^6$ or $1 \times 3^{-1}$
- **Missing or ill-defined values**: `NA`, `NaN`, etc.

---

## Atomic Vectors

- Base data type in R is vectors
- Vectors can be **atomic** (all elements have the same type) or **list** (elements can have different type) type

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.cap="sourece: Advanced R Chapter 3.2"}
knitr::include_graphics("summary-tree-atomic.png")
```

---

## Operators

- **Unary**: take **one** argument
  - e.g,. `-` for arithmetic negation, `!` for Boolean
- **Binary**: take **two** arguments
  - e.g., usual arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), mod (`%%`) and power (`^`)


```{r}
-7
7 + 5
7 - 5
```

---

```{r}
7 * 5
7 ^ 5
7 / 5
7 %% 5
```

---

## Comparison operators


These are also binary operators; they take two objects, and give back a Boolean (TRUE/FALSE)

```{r}
7 > 5
7 < 5
7 >= 7
```

---

```{r}
7 <= 5
7 == 5
7 != 5
```

Warning: `==` is a comparison operator, `=` is not!

---

## Logical operators

The basic ones are `&` (and) and `|` (or)

```{r}
(5 > 7) & (6 * 7 == 42)
(5 > 7) | (6 * 7 == 42)
(5 > 7) | (6 * 7 == 42) & (0 != 0)
(5 > 7) | (6 * 7 == 42) & (0 != 0) | (9 - 8 >= 0)
```

Note: The double forms `&&` and `||` are different! We'll see them later

---

## Testing types

- The `typeof()` function returns the data type
- `is.*()` functions return Booleans for whether the argument is of type *


```{r}
typeof(7)
is.numeric(7)
is.na(7)
is.na(7/0)
is.na(0/0)
```

---

```{r}
is.character(7)
is.character("7")
is.character("seven")
is.na("seven")
```

---

## Type coercion

- R will **coerce** values to be the same type
- R follows a fixed coercion order until all values are the same:  

character $\leftarrow$ double $\leftarrow$ integer $\leftarrow$ logical

```{r}
str(c("a", 1))
str(c(1, TRUE))
```

---

- Force coercion using `as.*()` functions

```{r}
as.character(5/6)
as.numeric(as.character(5/6))
6*as.numeric(as.character(5/6))
5/6 == as.numeric(as.character(5/6))
```

---

## Data can have names

We can give names to data objects; these give us **variables**. Some variables are built-in:

```{r}
pi
```

Variables can be arguments to functions or operators, just like constants:

```{r}
pi * 10
cos(pi)
```

---

We create variables with the **assignment operator**, `<-` or `=`

```{r}
approx.pi <- 22/7
approx.pi
diameter = 10
approx.pi * diameter
```

---

The assignment operator also changes values:

```{r}
circumference <- approx.pi * diameter
circumference
circumference <- 30
circumference
```

---

- The code you write will be made of variables, with descriptive names
- Easier to design, easier to debug, easier to improve, and easier for others to read
- When naming, avoid "magic constants"; instead use named variables (check out style guides in syllabus for more)
- Named variables are a first step towards **abstraction**

---

## The R workspace
What variables have you defined?

```{r}
ls()
objects()
```

> This is the same as what is listed in the *Environment* pane in RStudio

---

Getting rid of variables:
```{r}
rm("circumference")
ls()
rm(list=ls()) # Erases everything
ls()
```

> Remove everything in RStudio with the broom icon in the *Environment* pane.

> Caution: you may run into scripts starting with `rm(list=ls())`, but this is bad practice as you do not want to change environment of subsequent users of your code.

---

## First data structure: vectors

- A **data structure** is a grouping of related data values into an object
- A (atomic) **vector** is a sequence of values, all of the same type

```{r}
x <- c(7, 8, 10, 45)
x
is.vector(x)
```

- The `c()` function returns a vector containing all its arguments in  specified order
- `1:5` is shorthand for `c(1,2,3,4,5)`, and so on
- `x[1]` would be the first element, `x[4]` the fourth element, and `x[-4]` is a vector containing *all but* the fourth element


---

`vector(length=n)` returns an empty vector of length *n*; helpful for filling things up later

```{r}
weekly.hours <- vector(length=5)
weekly.hours
weekly.hours[5] <- 8
weekly.hours
```

---

## Vector arithmetic

Arithmetic operators apply to vectors in an "elementwise" or "componentwise" fashion:

```{r}
y <- c(-7, -8, -10, -45)
x+y
x*y
```

---

## Recycling

**Recycling** repeat elements in a shorter vector when combined with a longer one
```{r}
x + c(-7,-8)
x^c(1,0)
```

Single numbers are vectors of length 1 for purposes of recycling:
```{r}
2*x
```

---

Can also do elementwise comparisons with vectors:
```{r}
x > 9
```
<small>Note: returns Boolean vector</small>

Logical operators also work elementwise:
```{r}
(x > 9) & (x < 20)
```

---

To compare whole vectors, best to use `identical()` or `all.equal()`:
```{r}
x == -y
identical(x,-y)
identical(c(0.5-0.3,0.3-0.1),c(0.3-0.1,0.5-0.3))
all.equal(c(0.5-0.3,0.3-0.1),c(0.3-0.1,0.5-0.3))
```

Note: these functions are slightly different; we'll see more later

---

## Functions on vectors

Many functions can take vectors as arguments:

- `mean()`, `median()`, `sd()`, `var()`, `max()`, `min()`, 
`length()`, and `sum()` return single numbers
- `sort()` returns a new vector
- `hist()` takes a vector of numbers and produces a histogram, 
a highly structured object, with the side effect of making a plot
- `ecdf()` similarly produces a cumulative-density-function object
- `summary()` gives a five-number summary of numerical vectors
- `any()` and `all()` are useful on Boolean vectors

---

## Indexing vectors

Vector of indices:
```{r}
x[c(2,4)]
```

Vector of negative indices
```{r}
x[c(-1,-3)]
```

---

Boolean vector:

```{r}
x[x > 9]
y[x > 9]
```

`which()` gives the elements of a Boolean vector that are `TRUE`:

```{r}
places = which(x > 9)
places
y[places]
```

---

## Named components

We can give names to elements/components of vectors, and index vectors accordingly. These are referred to as attributes.

```{r}
names(x) = c("v1","v2","v3","fred")
names(x)
x[c("fred","v1")]
```

Note: here R is printing the labels, these are not additional components of `x`. Additionally, attributes can be lost in operation.

```{r}
names(x[c("fred","v1")])
```

---

`names(x)` is just another vector (of characters):
```{r}
names(y) <- names(x)
sort(names(x))
which(names(x)=="fred")
```

---

## Summary

- We write programs by composing functions to manipulate data
- The basic data types let us represent Booleans, numbers, and characters
- Data structure let us group related values together
- Vectors let us group values of the same type
- Name components of structures to make data more meaningful

---

## Peculiarites of floating-point numbers

The more bits in the fraction part, the more precision

The R floating-point data type is a `double`.

Finite precision $\Rightarrow$ arithmetic on `doubles` $\neq$ arithmetic on $\mathbb{R}$.

---

```{r}
0.45 == 3*0.15
0.45 - 3*0.15
```

---

Often ignorable, but not always

- Rounding errors tend to accumulate in long calculations
- When results should be $\approx 0$, errors can flip signs
- Usually better to use `all.equal()` than exact comparison

```{r}
(0.5 - 0.3) == (0.3 - 0.1)
all.equal(0.5-0.3, 0.3-0.1)
```

---

## Peculiarities of Integers

Typing a whole number in the terminal doesn't make an integer; it makes a double, whose fractional part is 0. 
```{r}
is.integer(7)
```

Force type integer by `as.integer()` or follow number by `L`.
```{r}
as.integer(7)
2L
```
